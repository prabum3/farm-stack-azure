- Azure Resource Group Name : Name of the Resource Group under which your Web app is provisioned

- MongoDB Connection String : Connection string for your MongoDB

- Azure Credentials : You would need to generate Azure Credentials scoped to the resource-group/subscription of all the Azure resources mentioned above.
This can be done by running the Azure cli command

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "GHActions" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} -sdk-auth

```
More detailed documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-a-service-principal-secret)

**Your app would be hosted at https://<azure_app_name>.azurewebsites.net**

 ## Local Development

 You can get started with your project locally by running the command

 ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up --build -d
 ```

 This sets up the website at port:5000
